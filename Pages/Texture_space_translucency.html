                Seeing Translucency implemented in a commercially available engine
                was the goal of this research. As well as the performance of the 
                implementation. 
                <br><br>
                While creating a demo showing the capabilities of the 
                techniques, that is accesable enough where the user can easily 
                try and adjust settings for himself.
                <br><br>
                The demo was made in Unity.

                <h2>Translucency physics</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's have a quick and basic rundown surrounding translucency 
                    so as to understand what it is and does. Making it easier to 
                    understand what was accomplished with this project.
                    <br><br>
                    Translucency is similar to transparancy as both phenomena are 
                    the result of light particles moving through a medium. In 
                    transparant objects like glass, the light can basically move 
                    in a single straight line. But for transparant object/materials 
                    the light gets scattered below the surface, causing it to give
                    of what can be discribed as a "shine". Which can be seen in the 
                    image to the right.
                    <br><br>
                    A way to simulate these lightrays going through our 
                    object/materials is needed. That way an approximation can be 
                    made using some good old math, the amount of light coming out 
                    of a position and thus the coloration of the material. The 
                    technique used is shown in the presentation by 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/ea/seed/presentations/barrebrisebois2019-state-of-the-art-and-challenges-in-game-ray-tracing-release.pdf">SEED - EA</a>

                    Now with that introduction behind us lets delve into the project!

                <p>
                    Engines don’t often come with a full and adjustable baking 
                    implementation made. So, making a simple and robust method to 
                    do it might be needed. A good example of this in the Unity engine 
                    is from <a href="https://snayss.medium.com/bake-a-pretty-or-computationally-challenging-shader-into-a-texture-unity-b524569d7384" target="_blank">Snelha Belkhale</a>. 
                    In which an orthographic camera and some custom shaders are used 
                    to render data onto a target and then save that target to a proper 
                    image.

                    Some progress pictures are visible below, with the right most being

                    The translucency calculations need some parameters to function correctly.
                    In particular the avarage depth of an object at each position (in our case each vertex),
                    which can normally be achieved through raytracign capable hardware in real time. 
                    Unfortunately for me my hardware is not RTX capable, so an alternative was needed.
                    Easy enough! In the raytraced solution mentioned in the SEED presentation the gathered 
                    data is stored into a texture. So we can do this as well beforehand and just keep using 
                    the same data. This way the hardware requirements are cirumvented altough perhaps 
                    at a loss of some visual fidelity.

                    The following steps will need to be executed. Our calculations shall be done per vertex 
                    of the mesh, so a high-poly mesh is preferred to carry across more details. To get the 
                    starting position for the ray, the vertex position must be added to the unit vector of 
                    the inversed vertex normal, as shown on Figure 6: The steps of the sampling method. 
                    From here a random direction may be chosen for the ray direction. It was suggested in 
                    the research of <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/rhlGBCSv02M?t=2513">Barré-Brisebois</a>, 
                    that an importance-sample phase function would be used for this. But this goes 
                    beyond the scope of this research. Rather a noise texture will be used to sample a 
                    normal from.
                    <br><br>
                    Having both the origin of the ray as well as the direction, a ray-cast can be made on 
                    the polygons of the mesh. From this the distance to the intersection point is kept and 
                    if there is more than 1 sample per vertex, it can average out the result. This way, 
                    a smoother and more accurate value can be achieved. The depth value can then be stored 
                    in the vertex color to be baked out in a texture later.

                <h2>Rendering</h2>
                <p>
                    Finally the rendering, placing a material that uses a shader with the Beer-Lambert 
                    calculation. As mentioned before possible idea was to have the precomputed step in 
                    the vertex shader. Yet due to hardware limitations and time constraints, I was 
                    unable to test this claim.
                    <br><br>
                    The fear of it simply being too expensive to render even 1 sample per frame on my current 
                    hardware is a concern. On heavier system capable of RTX-raytracing and the associated 
                    shaders in Unity this the issue would most likely not be there. Yet that is speculation 
                    as the implementation was run on a system with a GTX 1050ti. All this very much 
                    exemplifying the reason data is precomputed, especially for older systems.
                    <br><br>
