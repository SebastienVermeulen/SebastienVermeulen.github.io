            <h2>The Game</h2>
            <p>
                The game was made in 10 weeks, 2 of which are polish. It was made with a team of 5 people: 2 programmers and 3 artists.
                <br>It was made as a group project at Digital Arts and Entertainment. With the target platform being the switch, although 
                this was a stretch goal and a port has not yet been achieved.
                <br><br>
                The idea of the game is that you and a friend can hop into the world to explore and discover the creatures that live 
                in it. You are chefs and have to complete recipes of your choice. To do that you need to collect the creatures, which are 
                mythical versions of their real-world counterparts. A focus is put on teamplay as the players can dish out extra strong 
                attacks when they are attached to each other.

            <h2>Post processing</h2>
            <p>
                I made some post processing materials to make the game clearer. And to give valuable info to the players.
            </p>

                <h2>X-ray</h2>
                <p>
                    This effect makes players and creatures visible through other objects using a custom depth pass. 
                    It colors the mask grey, which replaces the original colour on the render target.                
                </p>

            <div>
                <h2>Outlines</h2>
                <p>
                    The defeated enemies spoil as they are ingredients, to show the player how spoilt they are I made an outline 
                    that dynamically changes colour based on said value. The colour shifts from green to red. This method also uses 
                    a custom depth pass but also samples the pixels surrounding the one being calculated.

            <h2>Water shader</h2>
            <p>
                A nice water shader was needed to make the scenes feels more alive. It needed to be cartoony and vibrant as well.
            </p>
        </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Edges</h2>
                <p>
                    So made a shader that has borders on all the edges where the water meets the ground. And I made it move slightly 
                    by multiplying a noise texture with it.                
                </p>

            <div>
                <h2>Depth fade</h2>
                <p>
                    Objects further away behind the water surface get blended away. This creates a nice transition below water.

                <h2>Refraction and Normals</h2>
                <p>
                    2 normal maps are panned across the surface making it seem like the flat plane has movement going on. 
                    This this into the refraction, as Fresnel is used to determine how much refraction should occur. As well 
                    as the distance from the edge of the water.             
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Emissive "reflections"</h2>
                <p>
                    On the top of the water surface there are these very "reflective" spots. That make the water seem very 
                    clean and sparkly. This is done with 2 noise textures, panning them along. Multiplying and then masking 
                    parts that aren't bright enough. Finally multiplying by a large number (to make them sparkle) and marking 
                    those spots for emissiveness.                
                </p>
