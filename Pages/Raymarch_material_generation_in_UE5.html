            <p>
                Initially this project was meant for some editor and slate programming.
                With the Unreal Engine 5 preview being available now.
                <br><br>
                Starting of this was indeed what I was doing, with the ultimate goal being able to use compute shaders.
                But I stumbled into raymarching instead and some very specific corners of the engine.
                <br><br>
                Custom materials and physics shapes rendered using a postprocessing material that is raymarching.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="editor-changes">
            <div>
                <h2>Editor changes</h2>
                <p>
                    To start of some changes were made to the editor. In particular 
                    to do with importing new file file formats. Using new file 
                    factories to parse and store the data in ".uasset"'s.
                    <br><br>
                    The new files that were being imported are the 2-shader file 
                    types supported by Unreal: ''.ush', ''.usf'. The shader code 
                    is simply being stored as one string. An editor button was also 
                    added to force a reimport of the file.
                    <br><br>
                    The reason these files were made to be imported though was for 
                    the customshaderexpressions. In the material graph of Unreal 
                    you are able to type hlsl-code in a small and clunky text box. 
                    So to improve ease of use and maintainability a derived class 
                    was made of said expression that accepts a shader-file instead 
                    of text.

                <h2>Raymarching</h2>
                <p>
                    Raymarching is a rendering technique similar to raytracing. Although 
                    with the crucial difference that the closest distance to each shape is 
                    calculated. The smallest of which is used to take a step forewards, untill 
                    we can determine a shape is clase enough to the new point.
                    <br><br>
                    This can be simple enough to set up in HLSL but for the material graph in 
                    Unreal this is a bit difficult. As it doesn't support for loops through 
                    nodes. We can however use for loops in customexpression where we can 
                    simply place some HLSL code. Now we can render a shape quite easily. 
                    <br><br>
                    There is one limitation though and that is the fact that our shadercode 
                    is rigid, in other words not modular. So to get around this we split our 
                    shader code up into separate parts: marching step, lighting step and the 
                    shading step. Doing this we can much more easily add as many shapes as we 
                    want. While also avoiding a lot of the expensive marches it would have to 
                    do with all of the shapes in one shader.

                <h2>Material generation</h2>
                <p>
                    With the new shader file type and a new customfileexpression type 
                    that can be used in the material graph we can move on to the next 
                    subject. Material generation, very specific but you will soon see 
                    why we do it though.
                    <br><br>
                    Everything in the material graph has a C++ counterpart, hence we 
                    are able to create a fully functional graph through code. It is 
                    very obvious though why the graph exists in the first place. It is 
                    simply tedious to do it this way but offers us great result once it 
                    is set up properly.
                    <br><br>
                    The main issue that will mostl likely persist is the spagettification 
                    of your graphs. Unless you add specific rerout nodes to clean up 
                    the graph you are left with a big visual mess.

                <p>
                    In the end we had our shapes that could be rendered but that is slightly boring.
                    Also, it is hard to play around with and discover bugs etc. in the shaders.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, the material was upgraded to a dynamic one, in which we update the 
                    position and rotation of the shapes. The physics of the shapes can be a custom 
                    collider. Although for shapes that are constantly changing thos might be a bit harder. 
                    But for simple geometric shapes like cubes, spheres, capsules and so on the default 
                    colliders will do.
                    <br><br>
                    I also added the collider debug lines to make debugging somewhat easier. In the future 
                    adding a sphere or actual light where the raymarched light is could also be handy.
                    On the bottom you can also see a little funny issue encountered along the way, in 
                    which the rotation calculations being used had some issue.

            <div>
                <h2>Editor preview</h2>
                <p>
                    An additional feature that I thought was neccesary was the preview mode.
                    When the mode is enabled it shows the initial positions of the shapes 
                    and only does so when the game isn't running in editor mode.
                    <br><br>
                    This was a bit more annoying to do then first anticipated. Due to the 
                    rigid nature of how editor settings work on a basic level. While in Unity 
                    for example adding additional editor functionality is straight forwards, 
                    here that isn't quite the case. You can still get around this though, by 
                    using the c++ extending slate code. Slate is the "pure" form of everything 
                    in the engine, writing something in slate is equivalent to describing the 
                    UI.
                    <br><br>
                    Also since Unreal doesn't really have a method meant for drawing gizmos 
                    for every tick or any editor tick function. I had to add said functionality 
                    to one of my classes, using some precompiler statements and inherited 
                    functions.
