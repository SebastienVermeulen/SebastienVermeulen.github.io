                This project was about making a level in the unreal engine.
                <br>I liked the result of it a lot especially the shaders.
                <br><br>
                This was also the first time I really started liking making shaders.
                <br>They are not as advanced for each object in the scen but there are a few ones that look quite nice.
            </p>

                <h2>The making of</h2>
                <p>
                    The whole idea for this level was that it would be this big moving 
                    and hot feeling factory or station. Having some cool air coming in 
                    through the top of the open room. While hot air builds up at the 
                    base and around the reactor core.  A blockout of the idea was made, 
                    afterwards 1 room was finished to have a feeling of the style. 
                    And lastly the entire level was finished (except unfortunatly the 
                    underground railway puzzle).
                    <br><br>
                    The result of the progress is visible below:

                    <h2>Resulting level</h2>
                    <p>
                        The level was finished as is shown below. With some intersting 
                        shaders to boot.
                        <br><br>
                        The level in the end consisted of a control room with multiple 
                        flashy screens, a engine room with lots of pipes and a glowing 
                        energy ball and finally a lounge for the workers to relax in. 
                        A super fast lift can take you from 1 side of the level to the 
                        other as well.
                        <br><br>
                        On the right you can find a playthrough of this level as well. 
                        And below you will find the final renders:
